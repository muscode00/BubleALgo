# Bubble Sort Algorithm

This is a simple implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in C. It sorts an array in ascending order by repeatedly comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Compile the C file using a C compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.

## Algorithm Description

The Bubble Sort algorithm iterates through the array, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated for each element until the entire array is sorted.

## Time Complexity

The Bubble Sort algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. It is suitable for small-sized arrays or nearly sorted data.

## Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function and main code for Bubble Sort algorithm

int main() {
    // Example usage of the Bubble Sort algorithm
    // ...
}
